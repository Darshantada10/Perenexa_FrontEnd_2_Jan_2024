        this is my first website

        head and body tags are children of html tag
        most of the html tags have opening and closing
        but there are certain tags which are self closed

        there are some tags which are blank or null
        they are called emepty elements

        we can use .htm or .html extension








        tasks 
        <!-- inspect some elements and view page source of different websites -->



        html is case insensitive
